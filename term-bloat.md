Tech has a word problem. We take normal words, give them new meanings in our tools and frameworks, and then mix those meanings up when we talk to each other. Two people can use the same word and mean completely different things — and neither one notices.

Here's a real example. I was talking with a colleague about React and global state. In React, "context" is a built-in way to share data across components. In many other frameworks, "context" means something closer to a database session or scoped environment. We never checked which meaning we were using. We spent ten minutes arguing before we figured out we actually agreed — we were just using the same word two different ways.

"Context" is one word. There are hundreds more like it.

## What can you do about it?

### Check before you assume

When a key term comes up, pause and make sure you both mean the same thing. Don't assume that using the same word means you're on the same page. It takes ten seconds and can save hours.

If you sense something isn't adding up, just ask: "When you say X, do you mean...?" That one question fixes a lot.

### Stay curious, not defensive

When something stops making sense, the easy move is to assume the other person is wrong. Don't. Ask a question instead. The people who understand the most aren't the ones with the biggest vocabulary — they're the ones who keep asking until things click.

### Write definitions down

When you settle on a shared meaning mid-conversation, write it down. A short list of project-specific terms keeps you from having the same argument next month. It also shows you care about clear communication, which is rare and valuable.

## Conclusion

Technical words carry a lot of weight, and they don't always mean the same thing to everyone. When something feels off mid-conversation, say so — "I want to make sure we're using this term the same way" — and sort it out before moving on.

Maintainable systems start with clear, well-defined concepts. Clear concepts start with people willing to pause and check.
