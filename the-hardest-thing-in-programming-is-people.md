The hardest thing about software is people.

Any reasonable person can learn to program. Even the deeper, seemingly complex concepts are manageable. Take pointers — they're just numbers that hold addresses to other locations in memory. Like reading an address on a letter. It's not rocket science.

Programming itself just takes experience. Sit down, learn it, try to make something. Put in the time.

But people? That's where real complexity enters.

## The Missing Information Problem

Technical problems have clear parameters. You sit down, work through the logic, and eventually solve them. But when you work with people, you're missing critical information. You don't know what someone's true incentives are. You're not them. There's always incomplete data.

This matters because all software automates existing processes. And those processes belong to people.

## Software as Automated Thought

Think about the evolution of human communication. First came gestures and grunts. Then speech — the ability to replay a thought process from one mind to another in real time. Then writing — recording those thought processes to travel across time and distance.

Software is the next layer. It's the automation of thought processes and mechanical tasks at a speed humans can't match. Everything software does could theoretically be done by a person with enough paper and pencils. But the speed makes it practical.

As a software engineer, you're not just a coder or a tinkerer. You're a thought automator. You watch someone do a process manually, then emulate it in software and make it scalable, accessible, downloadable.

And that's where the difficulty lives.

## The Distance Problem

You're distanced from the customer. You don't sit with them in their room watching how they interact with the app. You can use analytics and feedback mechanisms, but there's still a gap.

Then there's the founder or CEO with a vision. Does that vision accurately reflect the customer's actual problem? If not, the whole system might fail or stall.

What if developers get siloed? Software becomes increasingly complicated to write because there's no unified approach. Code is just documentation — documents we're trying to work on together. Silos break down organization and slow everything down.

The chain of information is fragile. Customer feedback has to break out of the customer's world, reach the business owner, get to the product manager, get prioritized, and then actually get acted on. Each link in that chain involves people with their own motives, desires, and goals.

When everyone has their own goals, it becomes a political game. People try to get what they want out of the system instead of contributing to it. This is where complexity explodes.

## Communication is the Foundation

That's why businesses fail. That's why building a successful software business is possibly one of the most complicated things you can do. Not because of technical complexity, but because of the human factors.

If you want to be a good software developer, learning to write and communicate effectively will do more for your career than perfectly mastering code. If you're already a tinkerer, already love programming, the next step to success is learning to work with people. Read them. Understand underlying motives.

Programming is more like writing and philosophy than it is like math. The math and science parts? That's actually the easy part.

The hard part is the people.

## Conclusion

Software is thought automation. Thought is human. And humans are the most complex variable in any system.

If you can't communicate as a thought automator, you're failing to do your job. The programming isn't enough to make it happen. Communication is the core, the foundation, the absolute rock of being a good software person.

Master that, and you'll solve harder problems than any algorithm ever will.
